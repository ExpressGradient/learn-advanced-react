# StrictMode
StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application.  
StrictMode does not render any visible UI just like Fragment.  
StrictMode runs in development mode only.  

StrictMode currently helps with:  
* Identifying components with unsafe lifecycle functions.
* Warning about legacy string ref API usage.
* Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage.
* Detecting unexpected side effects.
* Detecting legacy context API.
